*Cook* is an example application demonstrating the use of Config Server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Config Server product, please https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/[see the documentation].)

The main branch is using `spring-boot 3.0.0` and `spring-cloud 2022.0.0`. Check https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/tree/spring-boot-2.7[spring-boot-2.7], https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/tree/spring-boot-2.6[spring-boot-2.6], https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/tree/spring-boot-2.5[spring-boot-2.5] and https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/tree/spring-boot-2.4[spring-boot-2.4] branches for older versions.

== Building and Deploying

. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (macOS, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (link:scripts/deploy.sh[`scripts/deploy.sh`] on Linux or maxOS, link:scripts/deploy.bat[`scripts/deploy.bat`] on Windows), giving it the path to the application archive. (This will be something like `target/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` if you used Maven or `build/libs/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` if you used Gradle.)
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy.sh target/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
....
+
The script will create a Config Server service instance, push the application, and bind the Config Server service instance to the application.

+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the Config Server client dependency will cause all application endpoints to be secured by HTTP Basic authentication. For more information or if you wish to disable this, https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/writing-client-applications.html#disable-http-basic-auth[see the documentation]. (HTTP Basic authentication is disabled in this sample application.)
====

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]/restaurant`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the application. The &#8220;special&#8221; of the day will be taken from the configuration repository and the value of `cook.special`.
